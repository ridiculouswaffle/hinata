Welcome to my personal Emacs configuration! This is a configuration that is made to achieve 3 goals:
- It should be easy to use, even for inexperienced people (so that I can share this config)
- It should be beautiful, with icons and images! basically, _kawaii_!
- It should be incredibly useful, so much so that you can live in this config

The main reason I have made my config public is to make a cute config that has the quality of a distro.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This config is still in its early stages. While it can be used _right now_, it won't be as useful as a
> literal operating system

This is how it looks currently:

## How to use this config?

The detailed instructions are written in the `config.org` file in this repo, but for a quick tutorial, you have
to download the `config.org` file from here and open your `init.el` file and add `(org-babel-load-file (concat user-emacs-directory "config.org"))`
to use this configuration.

You can also simplify this process even further by just cloning this repo to your Emacs config directory.
